### [A website for a dublin based running community.](https://androsde.github.io/love-running/)

<hr>

## Welcome!

#### Running is great! Running is for everyone!
It is great for you health, helps bruning calories and can build strength.
It will improve your mood, makes you more awake and energetic.
It is a great way to meet new people and try new events.

Since running in a group is more fun because running alone can get boring over time.
This website will be useful for runners in Dublin, Ireland to see when and where they should be to join the running club.

### Features Left to Implement

- __Footer__
  - Connecting the social media links to the actual social media of the Love Running community (Since this is a Walkthrough Project, these do not exsit)

- __The Sign Up Page__
  - adding the main background image into the "image folder" (As this was a challange there is no download link for that picture available)
  - Database to save signed up user-data (Since this is a Walkthrough Project, it is just meant to show how one can make sign-up form, you can't really sign up for running)
